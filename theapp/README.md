# TouchTracker

For this project I editing the source code of the TouchTracker web app. 
An original creation of Marco Cancellieri (@Marcocanc)

TouchTracker is a simple web app for mobile devices that displays a greenscreen and records all gestures performed on the screen. It outputs a json file that can be imported into AE with the included .jsx script. The script then generates a new composition with the exact screen resolution and imports each gesture as an animated "Null Object".
