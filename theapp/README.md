For this project I editing the source code of the TouchTracker web app.
An original creation of Marco Cancellieri (@Marcocanc)
You will also notice that the logo is a light variable of the original one. You can think of this like a kind of TouchTracker2

TouchTracker is a simple web app for mobile devices that displays a greenscreen and records all gestures performed on the screen. It outputs a json file that can be imported into AE with the included .jsx script. The script then generates a new composition with the exact screen resolution and imports each gesture as an animated "Null Object".
